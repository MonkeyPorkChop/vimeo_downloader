I wrote this up for fun, to try to convert the bash script by Denver Gingerich and Jori Hamlainen to ruby.

VimeoDownloader can download vimeo rss feeds or individual videos.

It keeps track of downloaded videos in a very simple text file.

The RSS parsing is nothing fancy.

The only gem dependency is httparty.

It also requires ruby and wget. I'm using ruby 1.8.7

It is incomplete in a number of ways, but is functional

#Usage

    v = VimeoDownloader.new

For a single video

    v.download_video video_string

Or from the command line

    ruby vimeo_downloader.rb video video_string

video_string can be either 'http://vimeo.com/VIDEO_ID' or just 'VIDEO_ID'

For a vimeo video rss feed

    v.download_video_feed feed

Or from the command line

    ruby vimeo_downloader.rb feed feed_url

where feed_url is an rss feed of vimeo video links

Or copy vimeo_task.rb.example to vimeo_task.rb and customize for batch jobs
